For those that are curious, you can count up to 64 with the binary "slots" below:

`| 32 | 16 | 8 | 4 | 2 | 1 |`    

How would you represent the number 13 in binary?   
Start with the biggest number possible, which is 8. Leftover from 8 we have 5. Represent 5 with a tick in the 4 and 1 columns.   

```| 32 | 16 | 8 | 4 | 2 | 1 |    
   |  0 |  0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 |```

We see in binary that the number 13 ends up being 001101.

Binary is fun! Try representing 21:

`| 32 | 16 | 8 | 4 | 2 | 1 |`    
`|    |    |   |   |   |   |`
